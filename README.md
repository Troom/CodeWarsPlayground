# CodeWarsPlayground

This repo contains tasks that I solve in my free time.  
If you're browsing this repository, don't expect great things. It was created to motivate me to commit daily.

Anyway, since you're reading this text, remember that I didn't want to create the best possible solutions here. The main goal is to regularly develop yourself, which in the long run will bring great benefits.

Have a nice day
